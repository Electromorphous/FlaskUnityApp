# FlaskUnityHeroku
Repo for the web app made in flask that takes Unity WebGL build folders' zip files and runs the game

This was deployed on Heroku but it doesn't work cuz Heroku doesn't allow files to be uploaded to their apps so if u guys wanna try it out clone this repo and install the dependencies to run the wegi.py on localhost.

The Procfile contains the names of the dependencies u need to install to run the app

The zip files included in the repo aren't to be extracted by u but to be uploaded on the web app for testing
